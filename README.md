## 👋 Welcome to my GitHub Profile!
🚀 About Me
Hi there! I'm Arthur, a passionate learner and aspiring cybersecurity professional from Brazil 🇧🇷. I’m 17 years old and constantly looking for new challenges and skills to improve myself — especially in the field of offensive security.

🤖 Currently working with Python

🔭 Studying Java

🧑‍💻 Front-end Developer + Database Explorer

👨‍💼 Bug Bounty Hunter

👾 Pentester (and Mr. Robot fan)

🔧 Learning how to build and secure APIs


## 🧠 My Journey So Far

I began my programming journey when I was 12 years old, starting with Java and building simple games. Later, I moved to Unity and C#, where I truly fell in love with coding.


But one day, while watching YouTube, I stumbled upon a video breaking down real-world hacker attacks. I saw that blinking terminal, and that was it — I was hooked. What started as copying random commands into a terminal turned into a deep dive into penetration testing, ethical hacking, and vulnerability research.


After countless mistakes, dozens of "403 Forbidden" errors, and lots of persistence, I learned that real hacking requires knowledge, dedication, and structure.


## 🧪 Hacking Experience
Today, I’ve studied over 15 types of vulnerabilities, learned how to exploit and post-exploit them, and even practiced Wi-Fi hacking (on my own network, of course 😎). I'm also diving into social engineering and how it blends with technical attacks.


Most of my GitHub projects are tools I actually use in my bug bounty workflow or for research. I believe in open-source because together we can build a safer internet for everyone.


## 🐍 My Favorite Language
Without a doubt, my favorite programming language is Python. Its high-level syntax makes it perfect for quickly developing tools focused on security testing and automation.
